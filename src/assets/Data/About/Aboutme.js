    title: 'Designer, creative thinker and entrepreneur.',
    text: 'I am a multifaceted designer, who graduated in BA Product Design in 2019. I excel at creative problem solving, design ideation and entrepreneurship. I have a strong understanding of the Adobe Creative Suite, offering graphic design services for logo creation and branding, social media content and illustration. <br/><br/> I have over 3 years experience in design consultancy, working with a diverse range of clients, in industries including fashion, wellbeing, teaching, podcasting and book illustration. <br/><br/> Alongside this, I would consider myself a serial entrepreneur, with businesses in fashion, food and podcasting. Outside of design I am passionate about music, particularly Hip Hop culture, science fiction and anthropology. I enjoy breaking down pre existing norms, and challenging the traditional ways of thinking and practice. <br/><br/> Another passion of mine is travel, enjoying the cultures and art of other communities; visible through my like of bold colours and repeating patterns. I hope my work empowers, inspires and motivates; bringing you joy and unlocking your full potential.',
