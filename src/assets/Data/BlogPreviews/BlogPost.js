      'Writer’s block, creative block, designer’s block whatever you want to call it, it’s a blockage, brain constipation that can’t be budged by laxatives. If you’re reading this then most likely you’ve felt this feeling.',

      'staring helplessly at a blank piece of paper, canvas or screen; hoping to be saved by an idea that flies through your window and smacks you on the head.',
      '',
      'I recently had a conversation with a friend who was having difficulty designing the interior of her new business, she said “My business doesn’t have shape associated with it, its just pink.” A fair observation as we often think no further than the service/ product we are providing and being tasked to bring life to an empty space is quite daunting. My first observation I would like to talk about is how we view potential, the potential of a new room, piece of music or story we are about to write.',

      'Potential: the capacity to develop or come into existence.',
      '',
      'As a creative I get giddy when a new idea comes to mind that solves a problem or brings excitement to my current venture. I believe this is because I am aware of the potential and power of that idea and how I can turn it into something tangible and real. However I also feel at times frozen by the task in front of me, anxious about fulfilling the potential of my vision, falling short of the mark and never doing that idea justice with an end product. So I scrunch up the paper and for a brief moment I become a pro NBA player shooting for the basket, only for the paper ball to bounce off the bin and onto the floor, along with my confidence.',
      '',
      'My advice to you is to welcome that empty space with open arms, feel comfort from the opportunity to explore without boundaries. The key here is beating the race against time to fill the space whether that’s through a draft or mock up; fill that space with anything and everything that comes to mind. The longer the space remains empty, the more you feel anxious and discouraged by what lies in front of you. It is important to understand at this stage you won’t be finding perfection and appreciate finding out what you don’t like and want. Through a drafting process you will begin to discover what is right and you will soon feel that sense of flow that was nonexistent just moments earlier.',
      'ader to feel when reading your first paragraph, or a listener hearing the first bars of your song? Emotions are easy for us to understand, they’re universal and we often encounter an array of emotions in our day to day life; therefore a great place to start.',
      '',
      'My second observation is to observe our mental state going into any creative project. A healthy frame of mind will push you through challenges and lead you to a successful end product. I am ware that this is easier said than done, and it is by far the most difficult of the 3 things I would like to discuss in this post. Your mental health and wellbeing always takes priority and much like a creative project it is a journey, a process that cannot be rushed. Difficulties at home, straining relationships or finical difficulties are serious challenges and are unfortunately the result of our often unpredictable environment. The following suggestions are by no means meant to be a quick fix for all, however if you suffering from creative block these suggestions could be useful tools to get you back into that glorious feeling of flow.',
      '',
      'he burn of a good gym session, I often find walking to be just an effective tool when overcoming block. Sprinkle in your favourite album, good views and if you’re not living in the UK some good weather to your walk and you have the perfect recipe to overcome the most difficult of blocks. I would also recommend anything that brings you joy, again I am focusing on emotions as these are universal and easy to connect with. Whether that be cooking your favourite dish, calling a friend or reading a good book, fill your day with as many of those activities as possible.',
      '',
      'My final piece of advice for you is to observe your surroundings as our environment is a great way to find inspiration. I am a self proclaimed winner of university student room of the year from 2015 to 2019, undefeated in the field of uni art decor. Like my friend decorating her new business, I was faced with an empty space with bleak white walls in need of some TLC and sparkle. I took it as an opportunity to fill the space with things that I loved visually, album artworks, paintings, movie posters and club event posters that caught my blurry eyes on the night. I made sure that I was always surrounded by visually pleasing material, in hope that consciously or subconsciously I would find inspiration through the colours, patterns and themes around me. This is just one way you can use your environment to aid your creativity and overcome block; it could be your favourite park with a beautiful flower garden or a long sandy beach or even a hangout spot that brings back good memorie',

I hope this blog provided you with some useful advice on how I have personally overcome creative block. I would love to hear your stories on how you have blasted through block too and you can connect with me via my Instagram page @michaellinesdesign. If you loved this blog give it a like, share with your neighbour, postman and everyone you come in contact with. I wish you all the best with your creative ventures. Until next tim",

      '',
      `Naturally, the next thought is "who can I get involved or employ to take my idea and turn it into a successful business?" It makes sense that we would then ask family and friends to become business partners or team members, rather than strangers who's intentions, values and character we have no insight on. At least on paper it makes sense.`,

      'whilst at university in 2017, one of my go to podcasts whilst designing during our studio sessions. What attracted me to the show was the dynamic of the 3 friends, whilst having often very different takes on topics, the energy and relationship between the friends provided great listening and balance. I believe one of the reasons we mix business with friends is for the dynamic and balance between personalities, with hopes that it will replicate itself in the business world. To cut a long and messy story short, after 6 years, the 3 friends have now gone their separate ways following disputes over finances. ',

      `There are 3 components I believe are essential for a successful business, an alignment of values, trust in ability and insight and finally respect. I spoke to Christine, a member of For Da Dawgs Dem Podcast, about what she believed was the secret sauce for success. Christine, along with friends Jason and Nathan, launched their weekly music podcast in March, which has received a great response. Here's what she had to say: `,
      '',
      `My decision to mix business with friendship came from the fact that, knowing Jason and Nathan, let me know that we had the right level of chemistry, agreements and disagreements to make a podcast worth listening to. The way in which our styles are similar, but different, really helps the dynamic we have, and most importantly, we feel comfortable discussing various issues. I think something else that makes things work, is that we understand one another’s boundaries and we are able to check each other off the mic, which I think you’re less likely to do in a just business relationship. Knowing the people you work with, their boundaries and their limitations, really allows you to have a clear vision for your project. I recommend working with your friends, but I do advise that you’re honest enough with them before you start and communicate clearly about what it is you’re doing and how you are going to do."`,

In business, especially during adversity, egos become amplified, as do our character strengths, flaws and the importance of listening carefully.

      `I am very fortunate to have a close group of good friends that indirectly have an impact on my businesses. For example, having someone who can offer a second opinion in the industry you're working in, help you problem solve, someone who's concerned for your mental wellbeing or has an aye for detail, goes a long way. It is those types of friendships that will help you grow your business, to blossom both personal and career development, and help guide you through adversity. `,

      `Self-centred egotistic people: the "you couldn't do it without me" and "look what I have accomplished" types. This can happen when the business become financially profitable or if there is a hierarchy within the roles of the business. 
      Money/ profit orientated people: the "let's make money" and "I won't do it unless I get paid" types. Often I am asked by friends to launch businesses following the success of my own, with the sole reason to make money. A business orientated on solving a problem will make money, but a business orientated on making money will only make problems. 
      Wing it and let's see what happens people: the "it worked for them so it will work for me" types. Some lack of knowledge is to be expected, as we grow and develop our business, however if there are serious gaps in knowledge, there will be a strain on the trust between the team. `,

Most noticeable, what we took for granted, such as our health, visiting loved ones, a quick trip to the shops and a pint with friends; gone with a snap of the fingers.

Just replace Thanos with an invisible virus and Spiderman with the sight of shelves stacked full with toilet paper.   `,

      `that is true, having only recently graduated from university, and stepping into the big and often daunting world of adulthood; our time can suddenly be cut short. A perfect example is how we approach our career goals and aspirations, "Sometime in the future I'd like to have accomplished X, or start a business in Y;" often leaving out specific time milestones to achieve those goals. Without understanding a timeframe, aspirations will remain such, a hope, dream or desire, often forgotten and pushed aside as we continue with our busy lives.`,

      `ep 1: Stop, take a moment to look around, reflect upon your journey thus far.`,
      ``,

      `For the first time in history, many of us were forced to slow down, careers and education coming to an abrupt halt. No longer were we dashing to get ahead, caught in a chaotic rat race to the top. I found myself no longer employed, career plans scrapped and little to no social life for the foreseeable future. At first this was frustrating, what I thought was under my control was not; however this did not last long and I began to realise the gift that had appeared in front of me. Personally I had not taken the time to stop, pause and reflect on where I was in the present,  and where I had come from in the past. It had been 7 years of head down, pedal to the metal, thinking only of the future "where I could be" with little thought on "where I am."`,
      ``,

      `achievements unfairly compared to "one in a million" success stories. Imposter syndrome? Social media is the cause, and I am prescribing you with some much needed time out.  Once I had taken a moment to breathe and reflect on my journey, I began to feel more at ease. Confidence in my ability, planning and decision making grew, no longer was I an imposter caught playing a game of catch up. I had gathered myself, my thoughts and outlined a plan on how I would approach the remainder of the year. `,

      `Step 2: Stack the Ps, Planning, Patience and Persistence. `,
      ``,
      
      `With more time on my hands than I'd like, I revisited hobbies and passions I had neglected over the years due to work and education commitments. The goal I had set myself was to pursue entrepreneurship on a full time basis, turning passions into side hustles and into the final form of a fully fledged business.  Aware of my strengths, I began to sharpen them, and my weaknesses I started the process of mastery. It is important not to forget the process, having a respect for the time it will take. If you are unlearning a bad habit, which you've had for 4 years, it will take at least that to build the healthy alternative.`,

I signed up to online classes, in personal development, business and psychology, meeting people from across the planet; as new opportunities opened as we moved into virtual spaces.

      `he self, good mental health, a goal, planning, patience and persistence, which all require a vast amount of energy before you've even set up shop and made your first sale. I titled my first blog "The Time is Now," because I found myself being a champion of entrepreneurship. My advice to anyone struggling with the effects of lockdown, such as loss of income, uncertainty about career prospects or struggling to find purpose in life; if you are in position to do so, start a business. `,
      ``,

      `Business can seem a scary word, and I will be the first to tell you that entrepreneurship is no easy journey, I'd go as far as saying the most difficult; however it is the most rewarding, with no cap on the level of achievement and success. Start small, and be smart about scale, I don't want you trying to defeat Apple or Primemark as the new business on the high street. If its a fashion business you want to launch, start with a t shirt. First discover what you are passionate about, from those passions determine what you have the most skills in, or at least the desire to learn the skills required. A few examples of how you could start small:`,
      ``,

      `Offer expertise in your respected field of work or study to young people and students. This could be advice, coaching or even mentorship.  
      Start a consultancy in design, marketing or branding. Offering services such as logo design, video editing, animation, social media management to name a few. Many people are making the decision to launch a business, as well as existing businesses looking for a makeover in preparation for lockdown ending. These are services every business requires. `,
      ``,

      `whatever the idea, start local. Gain the support of your friends, family and community, word of mouth is a powerful tool. A successful business has a core of loyal customers, and you don't have to look far to find them. `,
      ``,

      `You've reached the final paragraph of my blog, so thank you for reading thus far. I hope I have shown you the reasons why the time is now to launch that business. I hope you leave feeling more confident, more capable and more eager to start the journey of entrepreneurship. Time is precious, as are your ideas, so don't let them go to waste as hopes and dreams. Good luck and go get it. The time is now.`,
